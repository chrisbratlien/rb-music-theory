h2. Overview

h3. Note and
A Note has a distinct integer value indicating its place on the chromatic scale.
I might as well make that compatible with the MIDI reference, even though I'm
not using this for any MIDI work as of yet.

h3. NoteInterval

A NoteInterval is used to transform a note into a new Note.

Similar to adding two Points together in Morphic, where the 2nd point is the 
transformation of the first point's x and y coordinates.

h3. Scales and Chords

Both of these classes require
* root_note (Note)
* intervals (array of NoteIntervals)

So I decided to derive both classes from a base class RootNoteWithIntervals


h2. Examples


h3. Notes and NoteIntervals
<pre><code>
  irb(main):025:0> Note.new("C")
  => #<Note:0x2679f4c @value=60>
  irb(main):026:0> Note.new("C").name
  => "C"
  irb(main):027:0> Note.new("C").plus_interval(NoteInterval.new(12))
  => #<Note:0x2674524 @value=72>
  irb(main):028:0> Note.new("C").plus_interval(NoteInterval.octave)
  => #<Note:0x2675438 @value=72>
  irb(main):029:0> Note.new("C").plus_interval(NoteInterval.octave).name
  => "C"
  irb(main):030:0>
